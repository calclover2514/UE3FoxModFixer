# UE3 Fox Mod Fixer v2.0
UE3 FoxMod Fixer fixes the common issue with Unreal Tournament 3 in which the Editor crashes on startup with FoxMod installed

This simple program will allow the user to create their maps while still maintaining their FoxMod installation/settings

As an extra feature, this program will also make UE3 run faster

Please inform me of any issues/bugs and I will fix them immediately

### Have fun!

### WARNING! This program will only work on Windows and has only been tested on Windows 10
